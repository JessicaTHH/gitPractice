# My app git practice 2

this is my app practice2

## Description
The main idea of creating this repository is to practice git command, also README.md documentation.

## What I use for the practice:
Git v2.19.1 and macOS Sierra v10.12.6
To check your git version, start your Terminal on mac, and use command 'git version', and it'll show the current version of git you have in your mac.
```bash
$ git version
git version 2.19.1
```
## Steps to practice git command:
 Steps below are what I used to practice git command for beginners.

1. Go to desktop, create and open new folder 'gitPractice'
```bash
$ cd desktop
$ mkdir gitPractice
$ cd gitPractice
```
You can make sure your location by entering pwd command.(should be at gitPractice folder.)
```bash
$ pwd
/Users/Spencer/desktop/gitPractice
```
